## Intro
This app still has the credentials on in the index file that we used at the meetup. Feel free to use the DB or add your own credentials!

## Build the app
First run `npm install` in the root. Then run `npm run build`. 

## Serving the app
You can run `npm start` which will build the app as well as serve it on localhost:3000. If you do not use the server, the app will still work after building it and then opening up the index.html file in your browser of choice.

## Other
The app uses [Riot.js](http://riotjs.com/guide/) for the front end templating.
